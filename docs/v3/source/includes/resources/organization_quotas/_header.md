## Organization Quotas

Organization quotas are named sets of memory, log rate, service, and instance usage quotas. For example, one organization quota might allow up to 10 services, 10 routes, and 2 GB of RAM, while another might offer 100 services, 100 routes, and 10 GB of RAM.

An organization has exactly one organization quota. If not specifically assigned a quota, it will have the default quota.
